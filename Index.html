                    <p> Hi, my name is Petr and I am from Czechia.
                    I am a technology ethusiastic with travel soul,
                    who decided to fullfill the biggest dream to become a software developer. 
                    Since september 2022 I am studying six months requalification course Object oriented programming at Technical university of Ostrava (CZ)
                    in online form and in addition on that courses at Udemy, Youtube and another sources.
                    </p>
